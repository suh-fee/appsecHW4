2.1

1. There are two types of intents; explicit and implicit intents. Explicit intents define a specific application or activity to follow up on the activity. Implicit intents do not and instead declare a generalized filter that needs to be performed, allowing any application/activity that may handle that action take over.

2. Explicit intents are more secure. Since they inherently declare which app/activity should follow up on the request, they avoid malicious application from taking advantage of the request and the permissions/data that request grants. Implicit intents allow any application that matches the intent filter to fulfill requests, which is inherently less secure.

3. The example is an implicit activity.

4. The example is an explicit activity.

5. Explicit intents are a more responsible way of doing an intent.

CHANGE MADE:

Instead of looking for any application to open that fits the ACTION_VIEW filter, I switched it (on line 69) to specifically use the defined user activity CardScrollingActivity, as the page it should direct to involves looking at all available gift cards post registration. I use the context activity variable, as the other parameters are passed in after through parameter assigning
